    Fix the missing action in the policy for replication role

      - Hint "Action":"S3:*" is not the missing action due to best practices being considered
      - The policy action should follow this format: 
            "Action": [
                    "s3:MISSING_ACTION_GOES_HERE",
                    "s3:ObjectOwnerOverrideToBucketOwner",
                    "s3:GetObjectRetention",
                    "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging",
                    "s3:ReplicateTags",
                    "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
                    "s3:GetObjectLegalHold",
                    "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration",
                    "s3:ReplicateDelete"

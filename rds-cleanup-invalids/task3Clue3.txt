 Clue 3:Clean-up Invalids - Walk-through to Solution

Step 1: Verify List of Remaining Invalid Objects. We should see as Count 2 (Procedures)

    Verify the List of Invalid Objects remaining in "ORAADMIN" Schema

      select object_name from all_objects where status = 'INVALID' and owner = 'ORAADMIN';

    We Could see two Procedures with Status as "INVALID"

      procedure oraadmin.CUSTOMERACCOUNT_LIBRARY
      procedure oraadmin.LOGINCUSTOMER_LIBRARY

    View the Procedues to Identify the problem within DB Link and correct it

Step 2: View each Procedure to Observe Reference to DB Link "CONNECT_TO_BRUCE" in it

Step 3: Verify Public DB Link from "DBA_DB_LINKS" with invalid "USING" Clause for TNS Details

select * from DBA_DB_LINKS;

Step 4: From Outputs, Use "BRUCE" user and TNS Details to update Database Link

Step 5: To update TNS Details

First Drop Database Link and Recreate it using Syntax below

drop public database link connect_to_bruce;

create public database link connect_to_bruce
     connect to bruce identified by cat
     using 'Endpoint.Address:Endpoint.Port/ORCL';

Step 6: Once DB Link is created. Re-Compile Procedures to make them Valid

alter procedure oraadmin.CUSTOMERACCOUNT_LIBRARY compile;
alter procedure oraadmin.LOGINCUSTOMER_LIBRARY compile;

Step 7: Please Verify Invalid Object Count is "ZERO"

select count(*) from all_objects where owner = 'ORAADMIN' and status = 'INVALID';

Once Invalid count is "ZERO" Challenge automatically updates as "COMPLETE". Please wait for atleast 3 minutes for status to get updated. User also can click on "Check my progress" button to complete the task and the challenge.

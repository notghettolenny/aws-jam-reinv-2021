Overview

The client has a business requirement where data producer applications need to put data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Data from the data stream is consumed by a Lambda function. The user of this challenge will need to verify scaling and failure handling requirements of the application and configure the Kinesis Data Stream and Lambda function accordingly.



 Task 1: Split to scale
Possible Points: 38 Clue Penalty: 0 Points Available: 38
Scenario
An administrative application that monitors shard data-handling metrics has observed delay in processing data in the last shard, as there is a lot of data directed to it. To reduce data redirection into the last shard, it is decided to the split shard.

Your task
You have to split the last shard of Kinesis Data Stream.

 Task 2: Update shard count to scale
Possible Points: 38 Clue Penalty: 0 Points Available: 38
Scenario
An administrative application that monitors shard data-handling metrics has observed delay in processing data. To adapt to the changes in the rate of data flowing through the stream, it is decided to increase the shard count.

Your task
You have to increase the shard count of the existing data stream to 8.

 Task 3: Scale without split
Possible Points: 38 Clue Penalty: 0 Points Available: 38
Scenario
An administrative application that monitors shard data-handling metrics has observed that the iterator age in each shard is high. To adapt to the changes in the rate of data flowing through the stream, it is decided to increase the Lambda invocations per shard.

Your task
You have to increase the number of concurrent Lambda invocations for each shard to 2.

Concurrent batches per shard: 2


ask 4: Avoid low throughput streaming
Possible Points: 36 Clue Penalty: 0 Points Available: 36
Scenario
An administrative application that monitors shard data-handling metrics has observed that during non-peak hours there are only 100 records per minute. To adapt to the changes during non-peak hours, it is decided to wait before invoking the Lambda.

Your task
You have to increase the batch window size to 180.
